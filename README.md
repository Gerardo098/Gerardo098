- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @Gerardo098.
- This is my personal GitHub in which I collect the code that I've worked on for school and on my own time.
- My account holding most of my big school projects is https://github.com/ceag1.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, particularly in game dev. The languages I have experience with are C, C#, C++, Java, and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently experimenting with code to accumulate more experience.
